## `Robot Tech Test Scenario`
Below is a fun coding task that we would like you to complete. It should be considered an opportunity to demonstrate your creativity and ability to think outside the box. The problem demonstrates the minimum required for the output.

A robotic rover is to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rover so that it's on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

A rover's position and location are represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

Write a simple application that takes a user’s starting point, and then directional instructions and displays the resulting position to the user.

### INPUT
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
 
The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.
 
The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.


### OUTPUT
The output should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

#### Test Input
'5 5'<br />
'1 2 N'<br />
'LMLMLMLMM'<br />
 
#### Expected Output:
'1 3 N'

## `End Of Robot Tech Test Scenario`



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
